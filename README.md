# AlternativeMedicineFinder

This project aims to develop a platform that assists users in finding alternative medications with similar ingredients. The platform addresses the common challenge of drug shortages in pharmacies.

**Project Methodology**

The project was executed in four primary phases:

**1- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Relevant medication data was extracted from various sources and subsequently cleaned to ensure data integrity. These steps were conducted using Google Colab or Pycharm.

**2- Database Development:** A robust database was constructed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 to efficiently store and manage the processed medication data.

**3- User Interface Development:** A user-friendly application was created using Visual Studio to provide an intuitive interface for searching and identifying alternative medications. The application seamlessly integrates with the backend database.

**4- System Integration and Testing:** The developed components were integrated, and rigorous testing was performed to ensure optimal performance and accuracy.
By following this structured approach, we successfully developed a comprehensive solution to the problem of medication unavailability.
