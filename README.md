# AlternativeMedicineFinder
This project aims to create a platform for finding alternative medicines with similar ingredients, addressing the common issue of unavailable medications in pharmacies.

The project has been done in 4 steps.

1 - Data Extraction

2 - Data Cleaning

3 - Data Base Development

4 - Developing an UI

The first two steps (Data Extraction and data Cleaning) can be performed using Google Collab or Pycharm, as you like. For the third step, I developed a database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18, and for the last step, I used Visual Studio to develop an application that connects to the database to give back alternative medicine options.
